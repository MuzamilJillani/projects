            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="hello_world" class="main-section">
            <header >Hello World</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <div class="code-div">
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
                    alert("Hello " + yourName);
                    }<br>
                   greetMe("World");</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
        </section>
        <section id="variables" class="main-section">
            <header >Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

        <section id="declaring_variables" class="main-section">
            <header >Declaring variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <div class="code-div"><code>var x = 42.</code></div>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <div class="code-div"><code>x = 42.</code></div>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
            <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <div class="code-div"><code>let y = 13.</code></div>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="constants" class="main-section">
            <header >Constants</header>
            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
            <div class="code-div"><code>const PI = 3.14;</code></div>
            <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
            <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
            <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
            <div class="code-div"><code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS <br>
                WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;<br>
                //statements }</code></div>
